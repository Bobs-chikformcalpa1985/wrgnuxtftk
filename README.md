OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Accountant 2 and like, I’m still processing. Seriously, Ben Affleck? Again? Can't tell if he nailed it or just breezed through it with his stone face, lol. The dude never smiles! But hey, action scenes were dope, no doubt. 

You remember the first one, right? All those numbers and math stuff like he's the Matrix but with a calculator? Haha, this one’s kinda the same but somehow even crazier. It’s like they thought, “Let's throw in more guns and less logic.” At least the explosions were on point. Can't hate on explosions.

> Also, halfway through, get this, I started thinking about this new sneaker design I’ve been messing around with. You know, dropping hints of neon against a muted base. Totally random during a gunfight scene, but inspiration strikes when it wants, I guess? Might call it The Affleck, lmao.

Oh, and the villain, couldn’t figure out his deal. A little too IDGAF but intense, which I actually rate. Felt like a wannabe James Bond type but eh, whatever works for the plot, right? Next time you gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   so we can cringe together.

Side note, popcorn was my dinner. Again. That’s gotta stop, for real. But then, priorities, right? Maybe gym tomorrow. Maybe not. Been playing around with this recycled sole idea—lightweight but sturdy? Could be a hit or flop, who knows. Or cares, haha.

function whyDoIDoThis() { return; }

Anyway, I'll stop rambling. Catch it when you can, so we can both shout at the screen about it. Hit me up whenever. Peace out!
